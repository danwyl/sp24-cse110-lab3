                Motivation: Production has gone down <em>twice</em> today,
                for a total outage time of 20/24 hours. This is absolutely a <b>P1</b> issue and should be treated as such.
                <br>
                There is <i>no</i> current idea or idea as to what the cause may be, or the resolution.
                <br>
                <b>Production is currently UP, but may not be stable.</b>

        <h3>What we Know so far</h3>
        <p>
            On TIME:DAY, we had a brief outage in production, and we automatically failed over to our second data center.
            Production was stable for X hours, but then again had an outage. 
            The original root cause had not been diagnosed or found, so the original data center remained down.
            The inability to fail over back to the main data center meant we hadn an outage for X hours.
            Main data center was rebooted entirely and brought back up, but is considered UNSTABLE currently.
        </p>
        <h3>Quantify Production Impact</h3>
        <p>
            Both data centers affected, implying likely not a networking issue from the provider end.
            Current code in main considered to be unstable, unsure how far back the issue has propogated.
            Infrastructure seems to be stable, so likely a code issue. 
            It seems like any customer data was still kept during the time frame, so no data loss.
        </p>
        <h3>Alert Customer Support</h3>
        <p>
            Every customer was impacted, and all of them experienced an outage for X hours.
            All customer support has been made aware, and have been told to acknowledge any outage.
        </p>
        <h3>Discuss Backup Options</h3>
        <p>
            No backup options occur currently, but all code development is to be frozen until the issue is figured out.
            Both data centers are currently so we have some failover. Rebooting a data center seems to work currently,
            but the time to spin that up takes X hours.
        </p>
        <h3>Find Production Issue</h3>
        <p>
            Currently combing through logs trying to find the issue. Still no identifiable cause.
        </p>
